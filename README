NAME
    RT-Extension-NotifyBasedOnOwnership - Adds scrip conditions and actions
    useful for suppressing notifications to queue watchers when a ticket
    becomes owned

SYNOPSIS
    Adds the following conditions to RT:

    On Create and Unowned
    On Create and Owned
    On Correspond and Unowned
    On Correspond and Owned
    On Comment and Unowned
    On Comment and Owned

    Adds the following actions to RT:

    Notify Requestors and Ticket Ccs
    Notify Owner and Ticket AdminCcs
    Notify Requestors and Ticket Ccs as Comment
    Notify Owner and Ticket AdminCcs as Comment

DESCRIPTION
    A typical use of these conditions and actions is to add scrips like the
    following:

        On Correspond and Unowned Notify AdminCcs
        On Correspond and Unowned Notify Requestors and Ccs

        On Correspond and Owned Notify Owner and Ticket AdminCcs
        On Correspond and Owned Notify Requestors and Ticket Ccs

        On Comment and Unowned Notify AdminCcs as Comment
        On Comment and Owned Notify Owner and Ticket AdminCcs as Comment

    If you add the above, you'll want to replace or disable the stock On
    Correspond and On Comment scrips targetting Requestors, Owners, Ccs, and
    AdminCcs. Otherwise, RT will send multiple notifications.

    Be sure to leave the standard scrips in place which notify "Other
    Recipients" so that "One-time Ccs" and "One-time BCcs" still work
    correctly.
